                Anyone that have worked with data from external APIs may have faced some limitations, such as request limit, server overload, connection problems and many other errors that may appear. The solution might be simple: <b>a worker or cron that fetches data from time to time and updates on a local database</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                As much as this is a quite common solution for this situation, there are many things that we have to worry when building this kind of worker: memory consumption, server infrastructure and, most importantly, scalability. As much simple a worker that fetches data from an API can be, there are many edge cases where a bad architecture can fall in.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, I have had (once again) the necessity of creating a worker to fetch data from an API. But, this time, I decided to spend time working on a good way to create this project. After some research, and many experiments, I have reached to an reasonable achitecture. My solution for this problem uses a <b>serveless Node JS</b> application, applied to an <b>AWS Lambda Function</b>, runned every week, storing execution messages into an <b>AWS SQS</b>. Also, all data is stored into a <b>MongoDB Database</b>, created into a Digital Ocean instance (lowest MongoDB instance price I have found).
            </p>
            <p>
                This post shows the definition of the problem, following the proposal of my solution, and the step by step to create the solution itself. Also, I will explain some definitions that may help anyone that never worked with any of these technologies.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
            <p>
                Suppose the case that you need to create an application that contains data of all video-games available. Users are going to navigate in your application, searching for video-game, starring the ones that they have, and adding their review. If you don't have these data into your database, the most common solution is searching for some API that contains the data that you need.
            </p>
            <div class="ui styled accordion" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
                <div class="title">
                  <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
                  What is an API?
                </div>
                <div class="content">
                  <p class="transition hidden">
                    Application Programming Interfaces, or APIs, allows applications to exchange data and functionality easily through an interface. Basically, web applications that contains an API provides a way to users retrieve data or execute some actions through specific rules. During the exchange, HTTP headers, cookies, or query string parameters provide additional security layers to the data. [1]
                  </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                Many APIs limits the usage of request by user. This means that you can only make an specific number of requests in an specific amount of time (10 requests per second, for example). If you apply API calls directly from your application (for example, any time a user searches for a game), specially in a large scale application, you will receive a lot of failed requests. Also, you may find the problem where the API is unavailable by any reasons, making your own application unavailable too.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, what if instead of applying the API request directly from our application, we create a background application that makes requests to retrieve data from time to time, and store into our application database? This would allow us to use the data directly from the database, and would solve the problem of having <i>n</i> requests to <i>constant</i> requests. In these situations, we usually use the <i>Master-Worker Pattern</i> (or just worker), allowing us to process data in parallel.
            </p>

                    The Master-Worker Pattern (sometimes called the Master-Slave or the Map-Reduce pattern) is used for parallel processing. It follows a simple approach that allows applications to perform simultaneous processing across multiple machines or processes via a Master and multiple Workers. [2]<br/>
                    <br/>

                The thing about workers is that, usually, they are created in the same application. This creates a problem where we need to worry about memory consumption and runtime errors. The solution for that may be simple as creating an external infrastructure to run this single worker, but having a single server to run an application that is executed on specific times may be expensive (and really unnecessary).
            </p>
            <h2>Solution Proposal</h2>
            <p>
                Considering all requirements and limitations, my proposal for this situation goes for a <b>serverless application</b>, as a lambda function, that is executed from time to time, fetching data from the API and storing into our project database. This would allow us to avoid worrying about errors in the same infrastructure, and still have our application running in parallel.
            </p>

                  What is serverless?

                  <p class="transition hidden">
                    Serverless computing (or serverless for short), is an execution model where the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) is responsible for executing a piece of code by dynamically allocating the resources. And only charging for the amount of resources used to run the code. The code is typically run inside stateless containers that can be triggered by a variety of events including http requests, database events, queuing services, monitoring alerts, file uploads, scheduled events (cron jobs), etc. The code that is sent to the cloud provider for execution is usually in the form of a function. [3]
                  </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                This lambda function can be executed from time to time, specified in a cron expression. Also, most of APIs uses pagination to avoid larger requests. To allow us to make requests based on pagination, and keep the requests per time ratio, my proposal also includes the usage of a <b>queue</b>, storing messages with the page parameter. We can configure to dequeue each message at the amount of time we need to wait for the next request. 
            </p>
            <div class="ui styled accordion" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">

                    A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. Messages are stored on the queue until they are processed and deleted. Each message is processed only once, by a single consumer. Message queues can be used to decouple heavyweight processing, to buffer or batch work, and to smooth spiky workloads. [4]

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The following image shows a larger view of this architecture proposal:</p>
            <img src="https://mariotoledo-blog-images.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/worker-achitecture.png" alt="Worker Architecture" style="width: 100%;" />

            <h2>Project Initialization</h2>
            <p>The following sections includes the step by step to implement the proposed architecture. For this implementation, the <a href="https://rawg.io/apidocs" target="_blank">RAWG</a>`s API was chosen as it seems to be the best gaming API available. It has 500.000+ games, and many cool data for usage. As their authentication is simple, we just need an API Key, available after registering an user on their website and providing info about the application you are going to build.</p>
            <p>The worker can be developed into any desired language. In this case, we are going to use Node JS, so create a folder for your application, and initialize the npm project:</p>
            <pre><code>npm init</code></pre>
            <p>A cool thing about Node is that, as many other frameworks that contains a package manager, is that you can find a lot of useful packages that improves development. A cool package that will help us in this project is named <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless" target="_blank">serverless</a>, which creates Lambda Functions automatically by using YAML syntax. It is pretty much convinient to deploy our code with a single line command.</p>
            <pre><code>npm install -g serverless</code></pre>
            <p>Before using the <i>serverless</i> command, don't forget to set up the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pt/cli/">AWS CLI</a> on your local machine. It will allow to use AWS commands for quick set up of your environment. Also, make sure you have configured your AWS Access Keys locally (this <a href="https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/guide/credentials/">guide</a> will help you with this). Then, you can use the <i>serverless</i> command to create a boilerplate project.</p>
            <pre><code>serverless</code></pre>
            <p>Fill in all required info, and check if the project is created correctly.</p>
            <img src="https://mariotoledo-blog-images.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/serverlesssettings.jpg" alt="Serverless Settings" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em" />
            <p>Before deploying the code, make sure you have everything configure correctly on <i>serverless.yml</i>. Also, make sure to check if the <i>region</i> parameter is added, and has the desired region.</p>
            <pre><code>service: teste

frameworkVersion: '2 || 3'

provider:
    name: aws
    runtime: nodejs12.x
    lambdaHashingVersion: 20201221
    region: sa-east-1

functions:
    hello:
    handler: handler.hello</code></pre>
            <p>To deploy the application, use the <i>serverless deploy</i> command.</p>
            <pre><code>serverless deploy</code></pre>
            <p>If everything went fine, you will be able to see your function created on AWS inteface (or using the <i>aws lambda list-functions</i> if you have the AWS CLI instaled).</p>
            <img src="https://mariotoledo-blog-images.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/functioncreated.jpg" alt="Function should appear created in AWS interface" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em" />
            <p>It is always good to test the function and see if its working. AWS Lambda interface provides a way to test the function using the orange Test button. Create a test event, and then click on the Test button again. You should receive a response displaying the execution results.</p>
            <img src="https://mariotoledo-blog-images.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/executionresults.jpg" alt="Execution results" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em" />

            <h2>Making the API request</h2>
            <p>Back to the worker, the first thing we need to code is the request to the RAWG API. To do that, we are going to use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request" target="_blank">request</a> package from npm. We also need to initialize npm on our project before installing the request package.</p>
            <pre><code>npm init
npm install request</code></pre>
            <p>Also, we are going to need the RAWG API key. It is always good to store this information on environment variables, and serverless allows to create these variables directly on <i>serverless.yml</i> file, inside the <i>function</i> structure.</p>
            <pre><code>functions:
    hello:
        handler: handler.hello
        environment:
            RAWG_API_KEY: xxxxxxx</code></pre>
            <p>On <i>handler.js</i> file, import the request package, and, inside the execution function, add the code to make a request to the API, adding the API key as a parameter. A good thing to notice is that AWS Lambda can deal with promises as a return value, so it should be good to return a promise, handling the request result inside it.</p>
            <pre><code>'use strict';
const request = require('request');

module.exports.hello = async (event) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        request(`https://api.rawg.io/api/games?key=${process.env.RAWG_API_KEY}`, function(error, response, body) {
            if(error) {
                reject(error);
                return;
            }

            resolve(body);
        });
    });
};</code></pre>
            <p>Deploy and test it. You should receive the API response as result.</p>

            <h2>Queue configuration</h2>
            <p>Now that we have our function making requests to the API, we should deal how we are going to navigate through pages to fetch all available data. As defined before, we need to create a queue that will store messages to execute the function with the <i>page</i> parameter. Everytime our function makes a request, it will check if there is more data available. If so, it should send a message to our queue, with the page incremented by one.</p>
            <p>Our first step is to create the queue on AWS SQS. Using either the web interface or AWS CLI, create a queue that uses the FIFO settings. Don't forget to include <i>.fifo</i> in the end of the name (that's a requirement for FIFO queues on AWS).</p>
            <img src="https://mariotoledo-blog-images.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/fifo.jpg" alt="Queue creation" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em" />
            <p>Also, it should be good to set the interval between message dequeue here. ON <i>Delivery delay</i> field, add the desired amount of time you want (1 minute should be enough). All other settings should be left as default.</p>
            <img src="https://mariotoledo-blog-images.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/deliverydelay.jpg" alt="Change the delivery delay to the desired amount of time" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em" />
            <p>After the queue is created, click on it, and open the <i>Lambda triggers</i> tab. Then, click on <i>Configure Lambda function trigger</i> button. Select your lambda function on the dropdown, and click on save.</p>
            <img src="https://mariotoledo-blog-images.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/queuelambda.jpg" alt="Select the desired lambda function to be executed" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em" />
            <p>The next step is to modify our worker to receive the page parameter and send messages to the queue when there is more data to fetch. To do that, we first need to install the <i>AWS SDK</i> package from npm, and import its reference on <i>handler.js</i> file.</p>
            <pre><code>npm install aws-sdk</code></pre>
            <pre><code>const AWS = require('aws-sdk');</code></pre>
            <p>First, we need to receive the <i>page</i> parameter from the message. SQS store message data into an array named <i>Records</i> from the received event. In our case, we will also be sending messages in a JSON format, so it is important to parse it. Also, parsing strings into JSON can throw errors on Javascript, so it is always good to add a <i>try catch</i> block. In our case, if there is any error, we will return the page 1, as it is the first page to make the request to the API.</p>
            <p>Create a function that receives the message event, and try to parse the message (if it exists).</p>
            <pre><code>function tryParsePage(event) {
    if(event && 
    event.Records && 
    event.Records.length > 0 && 
    event.Records[0].body) {
        try{
            let parsedMessage = JSON.parse(event.Records[0].body);
            if(parsedMessage && parsedMessage.page) {
                return '' + parsedMessage.page;
            }

            return '1';
        } catch (e) {return '1';}        
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>Now we should handle the message submission to AWS SQS. First, we need to copy the queue URL from AWS (located on the queue details), and store it on the environment variables from <i>serverless.yml</i>. Also, it should be good to add another parameter named <i>message group</i> as well, with any desired string (in lowercase).</p>
            <pre><code>environment:
    RAWG_API_KEY: xxxxxxx
    AWS_QUEUE_URL: xxxxxxx
    AWS_MESSAGE_GROUP: xxxxxxx</code></pre>
            <p>Then, create a function that sends new messages to the queue, receiving the page as parameter. To send a message to the queue, we just need to use <i>AWS.SQS</i> from the AWS SDK, and call the <i>sendMessage</i> method, passing an object with 4 parameters: <i>MessageBody</i>, <i>QueueUrl</i>, <i>MessageGroupId</i> and <i>MessageDeduplicationId</i>. Both <i>MessageGroupId</i> and <i>MessageDeduplicationId</i> should be unique, so we are using a concatenation of message group id and page.</p>
            <pre><code>function sendMessage(page) {
    const sqs = new AWS.SQS();

    return sqs.sendMessage({
        MessageBody: JSON.stringify({page: parseInt(page) + 1}),
        QueueUrl: `${process.env.AWS_QUEUE_URL}`,
        MessageGroupId: `${process.env.AWS_MESSAGE_GROUP}_${page}`,
        MessageDeduplicationId: `${process.env.AWS_MESSAGE_GROUP}_${page}`
    }).promise();
}</code></pre>
            <p>Finally, call this functions inside the lambda execution function. Add the page parameter to the API URL, and, after the request execution, parse the body response to check if there is a <i>next</i> URL. If so, we should send a new message to the queue.</p>
            <pre><code>module.exports.hello = async (event) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        let page = tryParsePage(event);    

        request(`https://api.rawg.io/api/games?key=${process.env.RAWG_API_KEY}&ordering=-updated&page=${page}&page_size=100`, function(error, response, body) {
            if(error) {
                reject(error);
                return;
            }

            let parsedResponse = JSON.parse(body);
            let games = parsedResponse.results;

            if(parsedResponse.next) {
                sendMessage(page).then(() => {
                    resolve();
                }).catch(err => {
                    reject(err);
                });        
            } else {
                resolve();
            }      
        });
    });
};</code></pre>
